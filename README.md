# hello-world
My first repository.

Hello,
My name is Andreas, and I am an Interaction Design student (2017-2019) at Kristiania University College, Norway.
My study involves various diciplines, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.Js, JSON, HAML and SASS, amongst others.

I am looking forward to get familiar with GitHub :)
